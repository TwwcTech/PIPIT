# PIPIT (Public IP Information Tool)

PIPIT is a powerful and user-friendly C# application designed to provide comprehensive information about your public IP address. Leveraging the capabilities of ifconfig.co, PIPIT gathers and displays a wealth of data about your IP, including geographical details and more.

## Features

- **IP Information Retrieval**: PIPIT retrieves detailed information about your public IP address using ifconfig.co. This includes your IP details and geographical data such as country, region, city, coordinates, and time zone.

- **ASN Organization and Hostname**: In addition to geographical data, PIPIT also provides information about your ASN organization and hostname.

- **Taskbar Tray Residency**: For easy access and minimal disruption, PIPIT resides in the taskbar tray. This allows you to access the tool at any time without it interfering with your workspace.

- **Dialog Window**: Upon launch, PIPIT displays a dialog window that provides a short summary of the information it gathers about your public IP. This window can be closed without terminating the application, allowing PIPIT to continue running in the taskbar tray.

## How to Use

Using PIPIT is straightforward. After launching the application, a dialog window will appear explaining what the app does. Once this window is closed, PIPIT will reside in the tray icon bar. From there, you can choose to open the PIPIT tool to display your IP information, show the main dialog window, or exit the app, effectively terminating its process.

We hope you find PIPIT to be a valuable tool in your IP information toolkit. Please feel free to contribute to the PIPIT project on GitHub and share any issues or suggestions you may have. Stay informed! üåê
